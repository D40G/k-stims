# D2D-Stims
4 Items intended for PvP (fragging servers) but can definitely be brought into RP.

> - Adrenaline: Gives you 100% health.
> - Meldonin: Gives you unlimited stamina and super sprint speed.
> - Anesthetic: Gives you 100% armour.
> - Ketamine: Gives you wobbly legs :horse:

I have not applied visual effects to the first three stims due to visual effects being quite annoying when you're trying to have a gunfight. They each have a subtle screenshake instead.

All stim shot effects last 25 seconds (changeable) and have the following:

> - Injection animation
> - Injection sound effect
> - Heartbeat sound effect

Installation guide:

1) Import SQL file into your databse.
2) Drag and Drop "D2D-Stims" into your resource directory.
3) Add "D2D-Stims" into your "Server.CFG"
4) Add item PNG's into your inventory system (if you wish)
5) Restart server & Enjoy!
